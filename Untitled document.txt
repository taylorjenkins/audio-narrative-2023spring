Since my audio preview, I added more layers such as my car driving and horns honking in the background. I have been playing around with the volume of my audios to try and replicate what it would sound like when a car was honking while passing them - with the audio lowering the further you got away.
I have been struggling to find a background song while in the car - I wanted it to be a more upbeat song in opposition with the mood because I was thinking of when I get in the car in a hurry and what I usually play. I realized that normally I let my phone just auto-shuffle when I’m in a hurry because I don’t have time to pick out what I really want to listen to, so the music doesn’t match the mood on purpose. I played around with the sound, so that when action was happening, the music fades into the background, but when things are going ‘smoothly’ the music is louder, as if you were listening to it in your car. 
I screenshotted a portion of my audio recording that I thought was good - I liked how my recordings of myself getting into my car and starting it sounded because it felt like I was really doing it.
