Guidelines for a Soundscape Narrative project, part of [Ben Miller's Composing Digital Media](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2023spring) course
Traffic Jam is an audio narrative that takes listeners through the perspective of a late driver who gets easily annoyed by the driving of others. Rushing out of her building and annoyed at the slow elevator, she navigates her way through traffic, not so smoothly, leaving a lot of honking in her wake. By using audio recorded by myself, with the vocal help of a friend, and sounds sourced online, I attempted to simulate everyone's inner road rage, especially in times of panic.
